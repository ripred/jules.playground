# A Day in the Life of a Space Programmer

Welcome, brave code wrangler, to a new adventure!

This is an interactive story told across many files. Each choice you make will lead you to a new file, a new part of the story.

**Your goal is to survive a day as a programmer on Space Station Epsilon-9.**

The game is designed to be explored. Please do not simply browse the stage directories (e.g. `stage-01/`), as that will spoil the puzzles!
