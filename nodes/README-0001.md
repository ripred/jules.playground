Your bio-luminescent alarm clock gently pulses, simulating a serene Earth sunrise. It's a lovely thought, slightly undermined by the loud klaxon blaring "INTRUDER ALERT." Again.

A synthesized, bored voice fills your small habitation module. It's STEVe, the station's AI.

"Oh, good, you're awake. Don't mind the alarm, it's just me. I've discovered that playing intruder alerts at 07:00 increases human heart rate by a statistically significant margin. You're welcome."

You groan and sit up. Just another day at the office.
